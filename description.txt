Create a system that processes categorized transaction events and flags potential fraud.
Apply a set of fraud rules per transaction based on different criteria and then store them in a data store.
Allow the retrieval of this data via an API.

SOME IDEAS:

Data needs to be streaming in real-time, so we can use a message queue like Kafka.
WHY: Kafka allows us to handle high throughput and low latency, which is essential for real-time processing of transaction events.

DATA will be categorized transaction events, which means we can use a schema to define the structure of the data.
WHY: Using a schema helps ensure data consistency and makes it easier to process and analyze the data.
EXAMPLE of categorized transaction events could include:
- Transaction ID
- User ID
- Amount
- Timestamp
- Location
- Merchant Category

We can apply a set of fraud rules to each transaction based on different criteria, such as:
- Transaction amount exceeding a certain threshold
- Transactions occurring in a different location than the user's usual location
- Multiple transactions in a short period of time
- Transactions from high-risk merchants


The system should allow for creation of custom fraud rules, which can be defined by the users or administrators.
These rules can be based on various factors such as user behavior, transaction patterns, and historical data.
Once the fraud rules are applied, we can flag potential fraudulent transactions and store them in a data store for further analysis.


API should have a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage the fraud rules and retrieve flagged transactions.
The API can be built using a FastApi, and it should provide endpoints for:
- Creating new fraud rules
- Retrieving existing fraud rules
- Updating existing fraud rules
- Deleting existing fraud rules
- Retrieving flagged transactions based on certain criteria (e.g., date range, user ID, etc.)
Overall, this system will help in identifying potential fraudulent transactions in real-time and allow for easy management of fraud rules 
and retrieval of flagged transactions for further analysis.
